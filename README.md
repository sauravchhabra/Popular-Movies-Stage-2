In this project the app connects to themovieDB API and parses the JSON received as a response.
The main screen of the app shows the poster to the user, on which the user can tap which then takes the user to DetailActivity screen.
The user can check the details in the DetailActivity of the movie poster that they have selected on the main screen. 
The app also works on small screen devices since it uses the ScrollView as the parent layout.
